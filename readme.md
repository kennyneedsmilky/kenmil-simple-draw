## -- Current Problems (Please help if you have any solutions). --

### Problem 1

We understand that there may be problems using this app in mobile mode on certain mobile browsers. This problem mainly happens becaause of the field that allows people to type in url to other websites (that isn't part of the app). We care currently looking into solutions that can fix this problem.

### Problem 2

There may be small UI bugs depending on the size of the window of the browser. This mainly happens when the web app is in mobile landscape mode. We are currently looking into ways to solve this issue and there may be a fix in a future major update.
